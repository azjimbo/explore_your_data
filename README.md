# explore_your_data
A splunk dashboard to gather and display information about available indexes, sourcetypes and fields available.


This dashboard provides and overview of the data that is available to query.

Click on the index below to review source types in that index, and then a sourcetype to review fields. Finally, you can click on a field to see sample values in that field.

Click "Show Filters" above to open a search window to search for specific index, sourcetype or field name.

When you run the build query, if a field/sourcetype/index is found, the entry will be updated with the date/time that is was found.
